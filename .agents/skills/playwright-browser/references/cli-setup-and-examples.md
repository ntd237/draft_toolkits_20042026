# playwright-cli Setup & Worked Examples

Reference for `playwright-browser/SKILL.md` — open parameters, platform notes, installation fallback, and worked examples for CLI mode.

## Open parameters

```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Emulate a generic mobile device (Pixel 10 for Chromium, iPhone 17 for WebKit).
# Prefer this when a mobile layout is acceptable: mobile pages are usually
# lighter, so snapshots are smaller and cheaper.
playwright-cli open --mobile
playwright-cli open --device="iPhone 15"

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
playwright-cli -s=msedge detach
# Delete user data for the default session
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## URLs with `&` on Windows

On Windows, `cmd.exe` and PowerShell treat `&` as a command separator, so URLs with multiple query parameters get truncated before `playwright-cli` runs. Escape `&` with `^&` in `cmd.exe`, or use `--%` in PowerShell (Git Bash/POSIX shells handle quoted `&` normally):

```batch
playwright-cli goto "https://example.com/?a=1^&b=2"
```

```powershell
playwright-cli --% goto "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2"
```

## Installation

If global `playwright-cli` command is not available, try a local version via `npx playwright cli`:

```bash
npx --no-install playwright --version
```

When local version is available, use `npx playwright cli` in all commands. Otherwise, install `playwright-cli` as a global command:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## Example: Form submission

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot

playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Interactive session (UI review / design feedback)

Ask the user for UI review or design feedback. The user draws boxes on the live page and types comments; you receive the annotated screenshot, the snapshot of the marked region, and the user's notes. Use this whenever the user asks for "UI review", "design feedback", or to "ask the user what they think / want / mean":

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli show --annotate
```
